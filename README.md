The focus of this project revolves around predicting the successful landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage. Notably, SpaceX's website showcases Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers' costs, which reach as high as $165 million per launch. The cost reduction is attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately determining the first stage's landing outcome, we can deduce the total launch cost. This valuable information may be employed in competitive bids against SpaceX for rocket launches by other companies. To accomplish this, the project involves data collection and formatting from an API. A successful launch example is provided as part of this supervised classification endeavor, conducted within the framework of the IBM Data Science Professional certificate program.
